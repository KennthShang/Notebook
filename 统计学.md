## 研究方法入门

The difference between the sample and population averages is known as: **sample error**

* x̅ stands for sample average
* μ stands for population average
* n stands for sample size
* frequency -> 频数
* relative frequency -> 频率（相对频数）
* mode -> The value at which frequency is highest
* median -> value in the middle
* Quartile -> 四分位数（将数值从小到大排序并分成四等份，处于三个分割点位置的数值）
* Interquartile Range -> 四分位距 IQR = Q3-Q1 表示统计资料中各变量分散情形且更多为一种稳健统计（robust statistic）
* Outlier -> more than Q1-1.5(IQR) OR Q3+1.5(IQR)
* Deviation from Mean (xi-x̅) 离均差
* Average Deviation(平均偏差) Absolute Deviation(绝对偏差) 
* Squared Deviation(平方偏差) SS(sum of squares) = ∑(xi-x̅)^2 
* Variance = mean squared deviations = sum of squares deviations divided by n (平均平方差)
* Standard deviation σ (标准差)
* 68% of data fall between mean±σ   95% of data fall between mean±2σ
* Bessel's correction Standard deviation = sqrt(∑(xi-x̅)^2/(n-1)) [In general, sample underestimate the amount of variability in a population(低估了总体中的差异值，因为抽样往往在数据中心)
* Sample standard deviation(After Bessel's correction) denoted as s
* z number of standard deviations away from the mean (x-μ)/σ

In an experiment, the researcher manipulates the independent variable, measures changes in the dependent variable, and seek to control lurking varivable

* A parameter is a number that describes a population
* A statistic is a nember that describes a sample
